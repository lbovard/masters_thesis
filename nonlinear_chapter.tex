\subsection{Selecting the resolution}

In order to do a full DNS, we need to resolve the Kolmogorov scales. The Kolomogorov scale is given by
\begin{align}
\eta = \left(\frac{\nu^{3}}{\epsilon}\right)^{3}
\end{align}
where $\epsilon$ is the energy given by
\begin{align}
\epsilon \sim \frac{U^{3}}{R} 
\end{align}
where $U,R$ are the characteristic velocity and length respectively (elaborate on R). It is to reformulate the Kolmogorov scale $\eta$ in terms of the Reynolds number by multipying by the characteristic length  $R$ to obtain
\begin{align}
\eta = \frac{R}{\Re^{3/4}}
\end{align}
In order to
