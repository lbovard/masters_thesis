\section{Boussinesq approximation}


The equations can be written in the dimensional from as (add derivation, Kundu? Batchelor? Others?)

\begin{align}
\frac{\partial \bm{u}}{\partial t} + \bm{u}\cdot \nabla \bm{u} = -\frac{1}{\rho_{0}}\nabla p - \frac{\rho g}{\rho_{0}}\hat{\bm{e}}_{z} + \nu \nabla^{2}\bm{u} \label{boussinesq1}\\
\nabla \cdot \bm{u} =0 \label{boussinesq2}\\
\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \bm{u}\cdot \nabla \rho = \kappa \nabla^{2}\rho - \frac{\partial \bar{\rho}}{\partial z} w\label{boussinesq3}
\end{align}
where we have the following dimensional variables
\begin{itemize}
\item $\textbf{u}(x,y,z)=(u(x,y,z),v(x,y,z),w(x,y,z))$ is the velocity field in the $x,y,z$-directions directions respectively,
\item $p(x,y,z)$ is the pressure field,
\item $\rho(x,y,z)$ is a perturbation density,
\item $\rho_{0}$ is a constant reference density,
\item $\bar{\rho}$ is ... ? ,
\item $g$ is the gravitational constant,
\item $\nu$ is the constant kinematic velocity ,
\item $\kappa$ is the constant molecular diffusivity.
\end{itemize}
Equations (\ref{boussinesq1})-(\ref{boussinesq3}) are a set of five coupled partial differential equations for the unknowns $\textbf{u},p,\rho$. Herein, we will refer to equation (\ref{boussinesq1}) as the velocity equations, equation (\ref{boussinesq2}) as the continuity equation, and equation (\ref{boussinesq3}) as the density equation. 

Maybe go onto non-dimensionalisation? 

There is a difference between the linear and nonlinear equations (MIke's code uses a slightly modified version of Boussinesq that uses temperature) 
We take the above equations (Ref) as the starting point for our simulations.
