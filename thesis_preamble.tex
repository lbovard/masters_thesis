\begin{center}\textbf{Abstract}\end{center}
Stratified flow is the essential underlying physical model for atmospheric and stratified flow. In recent years, the study of stratified turbulence has been more thoroughly investigated due to its difference from classical turbulence. As a first step to investigating the mechanisms of turbulence, linear stability plays a critical role in determining under what conditions a flow remains stable or becomes turbulent. In the study of transition to stratified turbulence, a common vortex model, known as the Lamb-Chaplygin dipole, is used to investigate the conditions under which stratified flow transitions to turbulence. Numerous investigations have determined that a critical length scale, known as the buoyancy length, plays a key role in the breakdown and transition to stratified turbulence. At this buoyancy length scale, an instability unique to stratified flow, the zigzag instability provides the mechanisms for this break down.  In this thesis we discover and investigate a new instability of the Lamb-Chaplyin dipole that exists at the sub-buoyancy scale. Through numerical linear stability analysis we show that this short-wave instability exhibits growth rates similar to that of the zigzag instability. We conclude with nonlinear studies of this short-wave instability and demonstrate this new instability saturates at a level proportional to the aspect ratio.

\begin{center}\textbf{Acknowledgements}\end{center}
Thanks to my supervisor Dr. Michael Waite. Good luck with the new addition to your family. Additional thanks goes to Dr. Marek Statsna and Dr. Francis Poulin. 

Obligatory thanks to everyone else who I have learnt and talked to over all these year. There are too many to name, so I won't. Just know that if you knew me I'd probably thank you. This saves me having to remember people and just cover everyone in one full swoop.

The work for this thesis was written under the music of Queen, Taylor Swift, The Beatles, Dire Straits, and Billy Joel. I kept statistics and it works out to be a few thousands plays of each, which is probably about 4 days straight of music per artists!

Richard you wanted me to add you punching Chris by mistake many years ago to this thesis. Here you go.

Special thanks to Patricia for making the last few months bearable. It made writing this thesis much easier. Thanks et merci y gracias por todo. 

Finally, and most importantly, I dedicate this thesis to the two best teachers I've ever had. Without both of them, who knows where I'd be now.
